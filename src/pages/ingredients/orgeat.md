This is a classic almond and orange blossom flavored syrup used especially in
tiki drinks.
Orgeat (pronounced OR-juh; it’s French) has a complex flavor profile that adds
a “what is that?” twist to a lot of drinks.

Some recipes for this can be rather complex,
but you can simplify the process greatly by using store-bought almond milk.
Just be sure it is not sweetened already so you have full control over the
final product and can predict how it will balance with citrus juice or other
ingredients in your cocktails.

* 3 cups white sugar
* 2 cups unsweetened almond milk
* 1 tsp orange blossom water
* 1/2 tsp rose water (optional)
* 1/2 tsp almond extract

In a sauce pan, combine the sugar and almond milk.
Stir over medium heat until sugar is completely dissolved.
Remove from heat and add orange blossom water, rose water, and almond extract.
Stir to combine.

Once cool, transfer to a bottle or mason jar and keep in the fridge.
It should be good for 4–6 weeks.
You can extend the shelf life further by adding 1/2 oz of vodka.

You can freeze half of the batch in a mason jar,
though I have found after freezing it tends to separate a little in a cocktail
after the drink has sat for a while.
This doesn’t affect the flavor at all, but it is a little unappealing visually.
