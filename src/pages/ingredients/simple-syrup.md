An essential in every bar, simple syrup is a way to add sweetness to drinks. Regular sugar won’t do because it doesn’t dissolve readily into cold ingredients.

To make simple syrup, add equal amounts (by weight) of sugar and water in a saucepan. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves; it will look clear. Don’t boil it, or you will lose water to evaporation. Allow it to cool, then bottle it and store it in your refrigerator.

You can also make simple syrup in a blender. Just add the water and sugar and blend until dissolved. The benefit of this is you don’t have to wait for it to cool, so you can us it immediately.

## Variations
Substitute other types of sugar for different syrups. Use demerara sugar to make a demerara syrup or brown sugar for a brown sugar syrup.

### Flavor Infusion
You can infusing flavors into your syrup to make your cocktails really stand out. Make your syrup on the stove as normal. Then, immediately after turning off the heat, add the ingredient(s) you would like to infuse into the syrup and allow it to steep in the hot syrup as it cools. When it’s cool, strain out the solids and store in the fridge.

You can infuse just about anything you can think of. Here are some ideas:

* mint leaves
* lemon zest
* berries
* ginger
* dried chilies
* rosemary
* blackberry and lavender
* black peppercorns
* cardamom
* cinnamon and pear

The right flavored syrup can take an otherwise simple cocktail to the next level. Don’t be shy with the flavoring; you can always dilute it down with regular simple syrup if it comes out too strong.
