Honey contains a small amount of protein which helps a drink retain a little bit of frothiness from shaking.
This helps give drinks a slightly velvety texture.

However, honey is just a little too thick to incorporate easily into cocktails.
You can make a syrup by adding a little water and heating to dissolve the honey in.
For every 100 grams of honey, add 64 grams of water (about a 3:2 ratio). For example:

* 300 g honey
* 192 g water

This will result in a syrup with about the same sweetness as simple syrup.

Keeps in the fridge for several weeks.

You can add infusions to honey syrup the same ways as you can with simple syrup. I infuse cardamom to make a cardomom honey syrup for the [Indian Winter](/drinks/indian-winter/) cocktail.
