Absinthe bitters are a house-made blend of bitters made at Employees Only bar in New York.
To make them, combine the following ingredients in a resealable bottle.
This will keep at room temperature indefinitely.

* 3/4 cup absinthe
* 1/8 cup Green Chartreuse
* 1/4 teaspoon Angostura bitters
* 1/4 teaspoon Peychaud's bitters
* 1/2 tablespoon Fee Brothers Mint bitters

These can be used to make an [Employees Only Martinez](/drinks/employees-only-martinez).
This may seem like a lot of work for one type of cocktail, but believe me, itâ€™s worth it.
