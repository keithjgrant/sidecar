Ginger syrup is one of the most essential syrups in a bar.
It is basically simple syrup that’s simmered with ginger in it.
Here’s the method I use.
I do a lot of “eyeballing it” and approximation when I make it; you don’t need to be too fussy.

* 250g sugar
* 1 five inch piece of ginger (around 75g)
* 250g plus about half a cup water

Roughly peel the ginger (use the edge of a spoon).
It doesn’t have to be perfect by any stretch, but too much peel can make the syrup appear darker in color, which is less appealing in some drinks.
Thinly slice about half of the ginger, and grate the remaining half with a microplane grater.
The more you grate, the “spicier” the syrup will be.

In a small saucepan, dissolve 250g sugar into 250g water over medium-high heat.
Once the sugar is dissolved, add the ginger.
Stick a spoon straight down in the pan and make note of the depth by seeing how high the syrup comes up the spoon.

Add about half a cup more water to the pan.
This is to account for water that will evaporate as the syrup simmers.
Bring it to a simmer and let it go for 30 to 45 minutes.
Check it with the spoon occasionally to gauge how much water has evaporated away.
Once the depth reduces back to the same level you noted with the spoon, it is ready.

Strain out the chunks of ginger.
Allow the syrup to cool and pour into a bottle.
The syrup will keep in the fridge for several weeks.
