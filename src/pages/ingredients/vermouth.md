Vermouth is type of fortified wine with added hints of various herbs and spices.
It’s a common ingredient in many cocktails, the most well-known being the [martini](/drinks/martini).

Vermouth is often under-appreciated, largely because old bottles of Martini & Rossi are all you will find in most home liquor cabinets.
This is the most readily-available brand in the U.S.
While their dry vermouth is passable, I find their sweet vermouth overly medicinal and a quick way to ruin a drink.
Let’s consider some better options.

## Dry Vermouth
If you mention vermouth to a non-bartender, they will most likely think of dry vermouth.
Dry vermouth (sometimes called “French vermouth”) is light in color, often with a hint of yellow.

My go-to dry vermouth is Dolin dry.
There are also several aperitif wines that are not technically vermouth, but are fairly similar, such as _Cocchi Americano_.
These can be used in place of a dry vermouth in many cocktails.

While needed for many drinks, including the quintessential [martini](/drinks/martini), I find this to be the least interesting type of vermouth.

## Sweet Vermouth
This is the vermouth I use most frequently.
Also called “Rosso”, “Rouge”, or “Italian vermouth”, sweet vermouth is reddish in color and sweeter tasting than dry vermouths.
he best-known sweet vermouth drink is the [manhattan](/drinks/manhattan).

My favorite is Carpano Antica Formula, followed by Cocchi di Torino, then Dolin Rouge.
Carpano Antica is a bit bold (and a bit pricey), with strong spicy notes and rich complex flavor.
Some would say this makes it too strong for balancing with lighter spirits like gin — I don’t necessarily find this to be the case, but Cocchi is probably the most versatile of the three.

## Blanc Vermouth
A less common type of vermouth is “blanc” or “bianco”.
Blanc vermouth is clear in color, but sweeter in flavor than a dry vermouth.
These are delicious and I find the flavor in some ways reminiscent of Sherry.

I recommend Dolin Blanc.

## Storing Vermouth
Vermouth is made from wine, so **it goes bad**! Once you’ve opened a bottle, store it in your fridge. It will be good there for about three months.

If you’re unsure, taste a little. If it tastes bad, it’s bad. If you have an old dusty bottle on your shelf, throw it away.
