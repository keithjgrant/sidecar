intro:
  Orange flower water can be hard to track down. I’ve been known to omit it in this recipe (in which case, use a coupe instead of rocks glass).

Chill rocks glass in the freezer.

Mist the inside of the glass with four sprays of orange flower water.
If you don’t have a mister pump, pour in a splash and roll around the glass to coat the inside, then dump it out.

Stir ingredients with plenty of ice and strain into the glass.
Garnish with another spray of orange flower water and an orange twist.
