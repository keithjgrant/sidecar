Add all ingredients except the bitters to a shaking tin along with
a large scoop of crushed ice.
Shake briefly (about 5 seconds), then pour into a chilled
rocks glass without straining out the ice.
Top up the glass with more crushed ice if necessary.

Float several dashes of Angostura bitters on top of the drink.

Garnish with grated nutmeg and a sprig of mint.
