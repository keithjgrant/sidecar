Add all ingredients except IPA in a cocktail shaker.
Dry shake, then shake again with plenty of ice.
Strain into collins glass.

Remove the ice from the shaker.
Pour in the IPA to combine it with the remnants of the drink still in the shaker.
Swirl the shaker a little so the IPA froths up a bit.
Pour frothy IPA over the drink.

Garnish with a lime twist.
