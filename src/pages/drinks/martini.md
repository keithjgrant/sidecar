  In my opinion, olives go well with a bolder or more juniper heavy gin (such as Tanqueray), while a lemon twist is best if your gin is more mild or sweet.

Add to cocktail shaker with plenty of ice.
Stir for at least 30 seconds, then strain into a martini glass or Nick and Nora.

Garnish with a lemon twist or a couple green olives.
