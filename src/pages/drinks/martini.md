intro: |
  Everyone has an opinion about martinis, and, I’ll be honest, mine is always changing.
  So here’s a great starting point.

  Consider your choice of gin.
  I recommend Plymouth.
  If it’s dry and juniper-forward like Tanqueray, you might want to omit the bitters and use an olive instead of a twist.

Add to cocktail shaker with plenty of ice. Stir well, then strain into a martini glass or Nick and Nora.

Garnish with a lemon twist.
