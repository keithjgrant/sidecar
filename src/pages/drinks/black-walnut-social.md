intro: |
  While this recipe calls for a specific amaro (a hard to find one, at that), it
  serves as a great template for experimentation. Find an amaro or herbal
  liqueur that you really like and pair it with a nice mild gin. Your selection
  will entirely determine the character of this drink.

  A combination I've been using lately is Mojave High Desert Gin and Calasaya Liqueur.

Stir well with plenty of ice. Strain into a rocks glass with fresh ice.

Garnish with an orange twist.
