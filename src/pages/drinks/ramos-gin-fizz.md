intro:
  Traditionally, this drink was shaken for ten minutes straight to achieve an impressive foam that rises above the rim of the glass. Thankfully, we’ve since developed techniques to make this a bit easier.
---
Add all ingredients except soda water to a cocktail shaker.
[Dry shake](/techniques/shaking#dry-shaking) aggressively for at least 30 seconds.
Add one _large_ ice cube to the shaker and shake again vigorously for a couple minutes or as long as you can take it.
Strain into a collins glass.

Allow this to sit in the glass for a couple minutes to allow the foam to separate a bit.
Insert a barspoon down the middle of the glass, and gently pour about half of the soda water down the barspoon handle.
This should guide the water down a narrow spot in the drink to prevent deflating the meringue.

Wait another minute or two for the foam to stiffen, then pour the rest of the soda water down the handle of the barspoon.
With a little practice (and a properly-sized collins glass), you will ideally develop a thick layer of foam that rises above the rim of the glass.

Add 3 drops orange flower water.
