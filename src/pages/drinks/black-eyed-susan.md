intro: |
  Several cocktails claim the name of Black-eyed Susan, but this one fits the name on so many levels I can't resist.

  Unfortunately, Suze can be hard to find in the U.S., and substitutes are equally difficult to track down. Salers is one alternative that may work, thought I haven't actually tried it in this cocktail myself.

Rim halfway around the edge of a coupe glass with a mix of equal parts salt and fresh ground black pepper.

Shake vigorously with ice. Strain into the prepared coupe glass.
