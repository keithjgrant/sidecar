intro: |
  Getting the balance right on this drink is challenging.
  It can certainly vary depending on which orange liqueur you are using.
  This is the ratio I currently use.

Shake vigorously with ice. Strain into a coupe glass.

Express the oils from an orange twist over the drink, then [discard the peel](/techniques/twist/#discarding).
