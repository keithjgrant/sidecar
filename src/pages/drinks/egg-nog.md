intro:
  Making a large batch of egg nog is a bit of work. This single-serve recipe
  is nearly as good and a lot less effort.

  If you're able to plan ahead, freeze whole milk in an ice cube tray
  and use the milk ice cubes for shaking rather than regular water ice.

Add ingredients to a cocktail shaker and [dry shake](/techniques/shaking#dry-shaking).
Add about five ice cubes and shake vigorously to completion (until all the ice is melted).
Pour without straining into a rocks glass or small mug.

Garnish with grated nutmeg.
