intro: |
  Created by _Employees Only_ bar in New York.

  If you don’t want to bother mixing up the absinthe bitters, you can substitute by rinsing the glass with a splash of absinthe or Green Chartreuse, leaving the excess in the glass.

  Best with a milder gin like Beefeater (avoid Tanqueray). Dry vermouth can also be used in place of blanc vermouth.
