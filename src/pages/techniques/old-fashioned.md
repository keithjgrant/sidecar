The _Old Fashioned_ family of drinks are cocktails in the most classic sense: a spirit, some bitters, and sugar.
A citrus twist was added to this formula early on.
The general formula is this:

* 2 oz spirit
* a few dashes of bitters
* a sugar cube or a splash of sweetener
* citrus twist garnish

Near the end of the 19th century, bartenders began dressing up this simple formula with various flourishes.
The most notable is the [sazerac](/drinks/sazerac).
This adds an absinthe rinse, to give the glass an aromatic coat before the cocktail is added, as well as more distintive bitters (Peychaud’s).

At some point, bar-goers were heard saying, “I don’t want that fancy stuff. Make me one the old fashioned way” — which is where the [old fashioned](/drinks/old-fashioned) got its name.
