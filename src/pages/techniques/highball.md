A _Highball_ is a cocktail made with a spirit and a non-alcoholic mixer.
The mixer is almost always a majority of the volume of the drink, so these tend to be lighter, more refreshing cocktails than those in the other drink families.
A classic highball is a whiskey highball, made with 2 oz whiskey and 6 oz of soda water.
Highballs are staples in homes across the country, from Jack and Coke to [gin and tonic](/drinks/gin-and-tonic), because they tend to be forgiving of un-measured pours.

A highball doesnâ€™t have to be mixed with soda.
An [Irish Coffee](/drinks/irish-coffee) is mixed with coffee.
A Bloody Mary is mixed with tomato juice.
Other highballs are mixed with juice.
