The _Martini_ family of cocktails is distinguished primarily by the use of [vermouth](/ingredients/vermouth) mixed with the base spirit.
The basic formula is:

* 2 oz spirit
* 1 oz vermouth

Bitters may be added, a small measure of liqueur may be included, and the amount of vermouth can vary significantly, but this is the general starting place.
Apart from this familyâ€™s namesake, the [martini](/drinks/martini) (gin and dry vermouth), other notable drinks in this group include the [Manhattan](/drinks/manhattan) (whiskey and sweet vermouth) and the [negroni](/drinks/negroni).
The latter distinguishes itself by the inclusion of a full measure of Campari, a bitter, sweet, vivid red Italian amaro.
