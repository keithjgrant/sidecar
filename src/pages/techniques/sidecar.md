The _Sidecar_ family of cocktails are similar to [the Sour](/techniques/sidecar), but with the addition of a liqueur.
This can add a lot more complexity to the flavor of a drink.
But it also makes it more challenging to get the flavor balance right.

While the proportions in a Sour rarely change, the addition of a liqueur adds both sweetness and more alcohol to the mix, so things need to be adjusted.
Typically this means a little less of the base spirit and a reduction or even removal of the syrup.
And since every liqueur is different, drinks in this category tend to end up with a varied set of ratios.

This category is named after one of the earliest of such drinks, the [sidecar](/drinks/sidecar), made with brandy, lemon, and orange liqueur.
These days, however, the [margarita](/drinks/margarita) is probably the best known drink in the Sidecar family â€” tequila and lime with orange liqueur added.
My [Tabs vs. Spaces](/drinks/tabs-vs-spaces/) is the same thing but with Green Chartreuse.
And a [White Lady](/drinks/white-lady/) is a gin and lemon with orange liqueur (and an egg white) added.
