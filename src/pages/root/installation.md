Sidecar is designed to work best when installed to your mobile device.
It is a PWA (progressive web app).
That means it’s a website that can be installed (i.e. “Add to Home Screen”). Installation is free, and comes with a few added benefits.

## Offline Access

This site works offline.
However, at some point, your browser will likely decide to delete the offline data.
By installing Sidecar, you ensure your device keeps that data saved, so you can pull up your favorite drink recipe quickly, wherever you are.

By default, only the drinks pages are saved for offline use.
Initial installation uses about 3mb of storage space.
As you visit other pages (such as tags lists or instructions on making [ginger syrup](/ingredients/ginger-syrup)) they will automatically save for offline access as well.

## Save Favorites

Installing Sidecar enables you to save drinks to your [favorites](/favorites).
If you find yourself coming back to the same drinks again and again, this a great way to find them quickly.

I have a few other features in the works as well that will only work when installed.
